STAR CARS — v31 CLOUD + RECEIVABLES PATCH PACK (for your working v30)

This pack keeps ALL your existing tabs and features. It only adds:
  • Cloud Sync (Firebase, free, DATA ONLY)
  • Vehicles search (type reg/make/model)
  • Directors' Funds (50/50 monthly profit split + manual deposits/withdrawals)
  • Receivables & Deposits mini-tab + Reports snapshot
  • One-click "Fix Tabs" snippet for old backups

INSTALL:
1) Open your working Star Cars v30 folder (the one with index.html, style.css, app.js, etc.).
2) Copy these files into that same folder:
     - v31-feature-patch.js
     - v31-receivables.js
     - cloud-addon.js
3) Edit index.html and add the lines from INDEX_HTML_INSERT_GUIDE.txt near the bottom.
4) Open index.html in Chrome (or push to GitHub Pages) and press Ctrl+F5 once.

Cloud setup steps are inside the README of the earlier pack. (Ask me if you want them repeated here.)
